#Economic analysis says tax-avoidance is around 20% in every country and this means Greece shouldn't be so cautious with tax avoiding because the percentage is around 20% and the problem is that the state is too big. Yet, this 20% of tax avoiding is crucial because only 1/10000000 of the people the person that governs Greece can ban for example whatever he wants through self banning and use of new rules...similar to a dictatorship. I think the economic analysis is not on the right road. Tax-avoiding is illegal. If we have more tools to uncover this sickness it's better. Moreover Greeks use Turkish coins for inevsting while in the same time N-O-N-E really supports Euro...People don't support Euro anymore because it seems people in Brussels are wacko and give money all around with out any control-double check, trying to give benefit to capitalists. The whole idea of it is crazy...
